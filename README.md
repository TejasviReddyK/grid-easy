# Grid Easy
_A wordpress drag and drop editor. To be used as a plugin. Still a work in progress._

**Enough with the editors already. There are dozens of them for WordPress out there. Where is the need for another?**

1. All those editors have been built to be easy-to-use for users who don't want to be bothered with writing HTML, CSS and handling grids. So, these grid builders make a lot of decisions for the users and add styles to grid elements. And when the grid-builder adds something that isn't inline with the design, those styles have to be unset. This is frustrating and counter-productive for developers who are more comfortable working with HTML and CSS. Writing your own HTML and CSS affords more control after all.

2. Most editors out there add shortcodes to the content, which makes it hard to just export the content.

Grid Easy aims to be an editor for developers by not making any assumptions, except one. It uses a grid-system that most UI developers are familiar with â€“ [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It also keeps the post content purely as it is and doesn't add any plugin-specific shortcodes.

**That's all good. But if a developer wants to write HTML, he will use the built-in HTML editor. Why this?**

Not all developers want to write HTML all the time. Sometimes a grid builder gets the job done fine. It's when things get messy that you want to review your HTML and change it. Grid Easy makes this easy by giving the user the option to switch back and forth between HTML and the grid.
